- Add PhaseListeners to reset sessionScope on user change and set the SessionID cookie to HttpOnly
- The model data sources need some work to bring them up to code for JSF components and to work with a direct value="" instead of only manager+key
- The REST API needs some fleshing out:
	- List of available managers
	- Full PUT implementation (or deciding to disallow)
	- Better error handling for situations like ACL restrictions
	- Testing, testing, testing
- Decide whether the event framework is worth keeping/expanding or replacing with a more widely-used variant
- This whole thing is probably super thread-unsafe
